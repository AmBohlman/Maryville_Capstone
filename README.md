## Overview

This repository contains the code, analysis, and findings for the capstone project: "Analysis and Insights Using Machine Learning Techniques on Air Pollution Data." This project focuses on leveraging machine learning to analyze and classify air pollution levels based on air quality data. The primary outcome is a comprehensive understanding of air quality patterns, supported by robust data visualizations and a detailed report of the findings.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of skills in data analytics, machine learning model development, and data visualization to derive meaningful insights from complex environmental datasets.

## Key Objectives & Features

* **Machine Learning Model Development:** Developed and implemented a machine learning model to classify and analyze air pollution levels. (You could specify the type of model here, e.g., "a Random Forest classifier").
* **In-depth Data Visualization:** Utilized Tableau to create insightful visualizations, identifying key patterns, trends, and correlations within the air quality data.
* **Comprehensive Analysis & Reporting:** Produced a detailed report outlining the methodologies, findings, and actionable insights derived from the air quality data analysis.
* **Data Processing & Preparation:** (Implied, but you can add a bullet if you want to highlight specific steps like data cleaning, feature engineering, etc.)

## Technologies & Tools Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Core Methodologies:** Data Analytics, Machine Learning
* **Data Visualization:** Tableau
* **Development Environment:** Google Colab
* **Key Python Libraries:** (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn - please list the specific ones you used)

## Project Structure (Example - Please Adjust)

* `data/`: Contains the dataset(s) used for analysis (if you can share it or a sample).
* `notebooks/`: Jupyter/Google Colab notebooks for data exploration, model development, and analysis (e.g., `Air_Pollution_Analysis.ipynb`).
* `visualizations/`: Tableau workbooks, exported images, or links to Tableau Public dashboards.
* `report/`: The comprehensive report detailing findings and insights (e.g., `Air_Quality_Analysis_Report.pdf`).
* `src/`: (Optional) If you have standalone Python scripts for specific functions or utilities.
